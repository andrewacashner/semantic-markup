The semantic-markup package provides a set of simple commands to allow for semantic markup.
The commands are inspired by the XML elements of the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
They are intended especially for scholarly writing in the humanities, including about music.
The goal is simply to allow scholars to write with attention to meaning and content rather than to formatting.

The package provides several semantic replacements for \emph and quoting commands, such as \term, \foreign, \mentioned, \soCalled, and \quoted.
It also provides a Footnote environment so that long footnotes can be more cleanly separated from the main text.
Because the author is a music scholar, the package also includes some macros for musical symbols and other basic notations for musical analysis.
All the commands can be easily redefined as needed.
